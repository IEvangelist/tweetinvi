# Filtered Streams

> Filtered stream return tweets matching a specific set of criteria. ([twitter doc](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/api-reference/post-statuses-filter))\
> Filtered streams support 3 type of filters, track (text content), location and users.

<div class="available-filters" style="">

        <span class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" style="margin-left: 10px; font-size: 17px;"></span>
    </a>
</div>

The sample stream supports all the generic stream functionalities. [Read more about streams](./streams-introduction).

## MatchingTweetReceived

`MatchingTweetReceived` event contains multiple information helping you understand why the event was triggered.

### MatchingTweetReceived - Properties

`MatchOn` - states which part of the tweet matched the filters criteria.\
`QuotedTweetMatchOn` - states which part of the quoted tweet matched the filters criteria.

| MatchOn             | Description                                                                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TweetText           | The text of the tweet matched at least one of the stream track filters                         |
| Follower            | The user who created the tweet matched at least one of the stream follow filters               |
| TweetLocation       | The location where the tweet was published matched at least one of the stream location filters |
| FollowerInReplyTo   | The tweet was published to a user matching one of the stream follow filters                    |
|                     |                                                                                                |
| AllEntities         | Any of the entities matches one of the stream track filters                                    |
| URLEntities         | At least one of the tweet url entity matches one of the stream track filters                   |
| HashTagEntities     | At least one of the tweet hashtag entity matches one of the stream track filters               |
| UserMentionEntities | At least one of the tweet user mention entity matches one of the stream track filters          |
| SymbolEntities      | At least one of the tweet symbol entity matches one of the stream track filters                |

`MatchingTracks` - contains all the tracks that the tweet matched.\
`MatchingFollowers` - contains all the user ids matching the followed users.\
`MatchingLocations` - contains all the locations that the tweet matched

`QuotedTweetMatchingTracks` - contains all the tracks that the quoted tweet matched.\
`QuotedTweetMatchingFollowers` - contains all the user ids included in the quoted tweet matching the followed users.\
`QuotedTweetMatchingLocations` - contains all the locations that the quoted tweet matched

### MatchingTweetReceived - MatchOn

Tweetinvi let you filter the results based on where the content was matched.\
The `stream.MatchOn` property creates a filter and the `MatchingTweetReceived` will only be triggered if this condition is met.

By default `stream.MatchOn` is set to `MatchOn.Everything`, which means that any tweet received regardless of the reason will trigger the `MatchingTweetReceived`.

``` c#
// configure the filtered stream to only trigger when a track was found in
// EITHER the text of tweet OR in the urls of the tweet
stream.MatchOn = MatchOn.TweetText | MatchOn.URLEntities;
```

## Start Stream

Filtered stream can be started in 2 modes, **ANY** or **ALL**.\
They define the conditions required for the `MatchingTweetReceived` event to be triggered.

|                    | ANY                                                                | ALL                                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trigger Conditions | A tweet matches **EITHER** a track **OR** a location **OR** a user | A tweet matches **BOTH** a track **AND** a location **AND** a user |
| Invoke With        | `await stream.StartMatchingAnyConditionAsync();`                   | `await stream.StartMatchingAllConditionsAsync();`                  |

**Table comparing Any and All behaviour**

``` c#
var stream = userClient.Streams.CreateFilteredStream();
stream.AddTrack("france");
stream.AddTrack("hello world");
stream.AddFollow(42);

// ANY
await stream.StartMatchingAnyConditionAsync();

// ALL
await stream.StartMatchingAllConditionsAsync();
```

## Events per filter

`MatchingTweetReceived` allow you to find out when a tweet matching your filters criteria was received.\
When creating a filter you can associate a callback that will be invoked when this filter is being matched.

``` c#
stream.AddTrack("hello", tweet =>
{
    // A tweet containing 'hello' was found!
});

stream.AddTrack("bonjour", tweet =>
{
    // A tweet containing 'bonjour' was found!
});

stream.AddFollow(tweetinviapi, tweet =>
{
    // A tweet was published by or related to the tweetinviapi
});

stream.AddLocation(centerOfNewYork, tweet =>
{
    // A tweet was published from the middle of center of New York City
});

stream.MatchingTweetReceived += (sender, eventReceived) =>
{
    // A tweet containing EITHER 'hello' OR 'bonjour' was found
};
```

## Events

The filtered stream supports all the [generic stream events](./streams-introduction#stream-events).

| Event                    | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MatchingTweetReceived    | Indicates that a tweet matching the criteria you specified was created                      |
| NonMatchingTweetReceived | Indicates that a tweet that is **not** matching the criteria was received (read more below) |

<div class="warning">

`NonMatchingTweetReceived` event can be triggered when:

* Your `MatchOn` stream filters has prevented this tweet from being matched
* Tweetinvi library can perform additional filters that Twitter do not support.
* Tweetinvi not properly understanding your filters. If this happen please open a ticket.
</div>
